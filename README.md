- **Dual-Mode UI**: Vibrant theme and E-reader friendly high-contrast mode
- **Cross-Platform**: Native performance on macOS, iOS, Linux desktop, and Linux mobile
- **Local-First**: Offline-first data storage with optional Supabase cloud sync
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins sync with `modifiedAt` timestamps
