## Technical Debt & Improvements

This document tracks known issues and planned improvements. Items that have been addressed are marked with ✅.

### High Priority

1. Model mutability - all model fields are mutable (no `final` keyword)
2. Missing validation for hex color strings, empty keys, or malformed data
3. UI performance - ListView rebuilds entire board on every task change
4. Missing loading indicators for async operations
5. Controller disposal - ScrollController and TextEditingControllers not properly disposed

### Medium Priority

1. Add more comprehensive tests (edge cases, error scenarios)
2. Add validation to models
3. Optimize performance for large lists with pagination
4. Error boundaries and fallback UI for error states

### Low Priority

1. Magic numbers throughout (padding values, line limits)
2. Extract reusable UI components where duplicated

### Completed (Reference)

- ✅ Split oversized widget files into dialog components
- ✅ Added error handling to TaskService with try-catch and logging
- ✅ Added retry logic to SyncService with exponential backoff
- ✅ Added timeout handling for Supabase operations
- ✅ Fixed rituals sidebar completion counter bug
- ✅ Renamed LuminaFlowApp to PhotisNadiApp
- ✅ Removed unused dependencies (riverpod, flutter_staggered_animations, glassmorphism)
- ✅ Added gitignore and removed build artifacts
